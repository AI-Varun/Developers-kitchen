# Developer's Kitchen: Swiggy Clone

Welcome to Developer's Kitchen, a Swiggy clone built using React, Redux, and the Swiggy API.

## Introduction

Developer's Kitchen is a project aimed at replicating the functionality of the popular food delivery platform Swiggy. Leveraging the power of React and Redux, along with the Swiggy API, I've created a user-friendly interface for ordering food online.
